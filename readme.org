* Vulkan Playground

This is an extension of the project made on vulkan-tutorial.com.

I've implemented specular and diffuse lighting, push constants and a first person Camera.

I am currently working on another project similar to this which would have better abstractions and controls with DearImGui.

** Building

You can clone this repo using Visual Studio and link the Vulkan, GLFW and glm dependancies. There is currently no makefile.

** Demo
